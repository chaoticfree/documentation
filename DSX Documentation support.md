# DSX Documentation support 

## Outcome

Activist communities in the United States have centralized curriculum and guidelines and uses best practice in digital security.

We achieve this outcome while following a set of guiding principles:

 * Communities and DSX Network curate together resources so that they are relevant and useful.
 * Partnerships with individuals and communities are a sustainability strategy and increase impact.
 * Common, open and interoperable formats contribute to engagement, iteration and sustainability.
 * Participatory communities and their outputs require moderation, maintenance and gardening.
 * Not all documentation is equally accurate, timely or useful.
 * Some resources should address context, not just security, such as managing up, convincing leadership of need for change, changing culture and habits.
 * Impactful change is building capacity of partners in the long term.

## Objectives
 * Research identifies core partners, assess community needs and maps the political space. It identifies existing resources and gaps.
 * Development of an online platform is conceptualized.
 * Implementation of the platform leads to strategic planning for sustainability of the project.

## Activities

### Research

1. Identify core partners who represent the community

 * What is the status of existing efforts? Do they need financial or human support? What can the DSX offer? Should we partner up or provide support for existing efforts?

2. Conduct a needs assessment with partners and map the political space

 * What is working for communities outside the U.S.?
 * What is needed in the U.S.?

3. Identify existing resources and gaps

 * What curricula exist already? Who are they designed for?
 * What are the gaps for what is needed in the US with what is already out there (and also good)?
 * Who is creating and maintaining documentation?
 * Does the documentation need modernizing?

### Development: Conceiving of a new or adapted platform

 * What is best practice when creating a new list of lists (who has done this well in any sector)? Look for examples to model.
 * Format: Is it necessary to unify existing documentation using a universal, open, easy-to-use format and platform (e.g. plaintext/Markdown/git)?
 * How do we handle bringing in pieces of an existing resource, such as one module on this topic but not everything?
 * Linked to the core DSX site and platform?
 * Who would our core partners be on this? Would they overlap with DSX partners? Engineroom would be excellent on this.
 * How can we integrate this into the mission of DSX to connect capacity builders with orgs in need?
 * Not all resources are the same. How do we display the resources in a way that puts up front the goal of the resource and its niche? Like LevelUp is for trainers. SIAB is for end users but best delivered by a trainer. First-aid kit is for self-help online, etc.
 * Deciding what to do about resources relevant to this field that are not related to digital security directly in terms of content. Like a "code of conduct" at trainings, for example.
 * How do the soft skills and context sensitivity show up in documentation? Perhaps another case of clearly presenting "niche".

### Implementation: Publishing positions

 * Working with DSX to develop “positions,” or suggestions – documentation in context
 * Use versioning to keep everything up-to-date (partnering with authors)
 * Introducing “new” resources and filling in gaps identified in the research phase like border crossing recommendations, yubikeys, use of Chromebooks, etc
 * How to "mash up" existing resources but tweaking or localizing them.
 * What's the workflow when you've used 75% of a resource. Do you now maintain two copies of what is essentially the same document from now on?
